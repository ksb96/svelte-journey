# Svelte

1) What is svelte?
- Svelte is a web development framework that streamlines the process of building websites by letting you write code more directly and producing efficient, fast websites or applications.

2) Explanation of build-time v/s run-time?
- Build-time is all about preparing and setting things up before the actual execution, just like gathering ingredients and following a recipe before baking a cake. 
Run-time is when the program is running and doing its work, just like the cake is baking in the oven.

3) What are Components?
- In Svelte, an application is composed from one or more components. A component is a reusable self-contained block of code that encapsulates HTML, CSS and JavaScript that **belong together**, written into a *.svelte file*.
